## How to run locally
First you will need to install npm, which comes with node.js.  You can get that by going to here:

    https://npmjs.org/

Then, go into the root directory of the project and type:

    npm install
    
Once that is done, you can run the project in your browser by typing:

    npm start

That will start a local server.  To view the demo in your browser, connect to localhost on the port that shows up.  For example, http://localhost:9966
